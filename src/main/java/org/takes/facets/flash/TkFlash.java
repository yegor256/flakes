/**
 * Take that understands Flash cookie and converts it into a HTTP header.
 *
 * <p>This decorator helps your "take" to automate flash messages and
 * destroy cookies on their way back,
 * from the browser to the server. This is what a browser will send back:
 *
 * <pre> GET / HTTP/1.1
 * Host: www.example.com
 * Cookie: RsFlash=can%27t%20save%20your%20post%2C%20sorry/SEVERE</pre>
 *
 * <p>This decorator adds "Set-Cookie" with an empty
 * value to the response. That's all it's doing. All you need to do
 * is to decorate your existing "take", for example:
 *
 * <pre> new FtBasic(
 *   new TkFlash(TkFork(new FkRegex("/", "hello, world!"))), 8080
 *  ).start(Exit.NEVER);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The class is immutable and thread-safe.
