/**
 * Fork take.
 *
 * <p>This is the implementation of {@link org.takes.Take} that
 * routes the requests to another take, using a collection of forks
 * to pick the right one. The best example is a routing by regular
 * expression, for example:
 *
 * <pre> Take take = new TkFork(
 *   new FkRegex("/home", new TkHome()),
 *   new FkRegex("/account", new TkAccount())
 * );</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here, {@link TkFork} will try to call these
 * "forks" one by one, asking whether they accept the request. The first
 * one that reacts will get control. Each "fork" is an implementation
 * of {@link org.takes.facets.fork.Fork}.
 *
 * <p>The class is immutable and thread-safe.
