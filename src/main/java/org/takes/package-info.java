/**
 * Take, Java web development framework.
 *
 * <p>Take is a pure object-oriented and immutable web development framework
 * for Java 6+ projects. The design of Take is based on four fundamental
 * principles: 1) no NULLs, 2) no mutable classes, 3) no public static
 * method, and 4) no type casting. Due to these principles, the design
 * is loosely coupled, highly cohesive and easy to test. To start
 * working with the framework, check out our introduction page in Github:
 * <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/take">README</a>.
